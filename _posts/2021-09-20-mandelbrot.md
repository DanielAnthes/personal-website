title: The Mandelbrot set
---

As a first 'proper' bit of content for this website I want to revisit an old mini-project of mine - creating an image of the Mandelbrot set in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

To break with the tradition of most cooking content on the internet, I'll start with the important stuff first: An image of the final product and the recipe.


<img title="the Mandelbrot set" alt="plot of the mandelbrot set" src="/assets/mandelbrot.png">

The script to generate the plot (minus some cropping to make it look nice for this post) can be found in [this](https://github.com/DanielAnthes/JuliaMandelbrot) GitHub repository.
